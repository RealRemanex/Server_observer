# Server_observer
Everything needed to observe a server over the local network

The system has three different parts.
1. Website. This is to show the stats of the server
2. A python script which works as a server on the same machine as the webserver
3. A python script which works on the servers, which should be observed. This can, but don't have to be, the same server as the webserver.

On the webserver is a possibility to change the observed server whithout to reload the site.

The website uses [smoothie Charts](http://www.smoothiecharts.org). The javascript-file is included in this project, to reduce the amount of downloads.

## observer.py 
This script is the part, which observs the server and give the data to the website.
The script implements a websocket server and send every second a datapackage to the website. The server can handle multiple connections simultan, but the data are read for every connection seperat.
At the start, the file disk.yaml is read. This file has a list of all disk, which should be observed. If the list is changed, the script needs to be restartet, to adapt the changes.

## config.py
This script has to be run on the same machine as the webserver. In the moment, this has also an websocket server. This server only send a list of ip addresses and ports to the website. This list is read from the config.yaml file. After this list is send, the server does nothing. It is planed, to use this server for later task.

## yaml files
Both yaml-files should be placed in the same place as the corresponding python script.

## html directorie
This directorie has evers file for the website, to display the values send from the observer script.


### Observer.html
This is the html file, of the website.

### css/observer.css
